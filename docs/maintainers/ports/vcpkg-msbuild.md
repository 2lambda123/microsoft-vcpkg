# vcpkg-msbuild

This port contains cmake functions for dealing with an MSBuild buildsystem.

In the common case, [`vcpkg_msbuild_install()`] (with appropriate arguments)
will be enough to build and install a port.
Read the documentation there for more information.

[`vcpkg_msbuild_install()`]: vcpkg-msbuild/vcpkg_msbuild_install.md
