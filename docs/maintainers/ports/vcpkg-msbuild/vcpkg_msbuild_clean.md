# vcpkg_msbuild_msbuild

The latest version of this document lives in the [vcpkg repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/maintainers/ports/vcpkg-msbuild/vcpkg_msbuild_clean.md).

Clean intermediate files generated by [`vcpkg_msbuild_install()`].

```cmake
vcpkg_msbuild_clean()
```

This should only be called if the `SKIP_CLEAN` option is passed to `vcpkg_msbuild_install()`;
otherwise, this function is called automatically.
