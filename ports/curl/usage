The package curl is compatible with CMake targets:

    find_package(CURL CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${CURL_LIBRARIES})
    target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${CURL_INCLUDE_DIRS})

If you want to use find_pacakge(CURL MODULE REQUIRED),
you need to override cmake module with a bundled one,
because built-in CMake module has a bug not to be able to find debug
library in Windows. https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/17887
Please copy FindCURL.cmake into where CMAKE_MODULE_PATH specified.
