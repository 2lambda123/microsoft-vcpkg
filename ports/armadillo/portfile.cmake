#armadillo.dll from ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/wrapper.cpp should be deleted, it's meaningless for windowsï¼Œyour should link to related lib directly
#for vcpkg user, you should just install one implementation if you enable vcpkg integration, as the the system will link to all the installed lib, which will cause conflict
#BTW, dll has no lib is not allow by vcpkg, maybe a patch for upstream will fix it?
