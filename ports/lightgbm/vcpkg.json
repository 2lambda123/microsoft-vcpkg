    "A fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosting (GBT, GBDT, GBRT, GBM or MART) framework based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks.",
    "LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with the following advantages: faster training speed and higher efficiency, lower memory usage, better accuracy, support of parallel, distributed, and GPU learning, capable of handling large-scale data.",
    "Benefiting from these advantages, LightGBM is being widely-used in many winning solutions of machine learning competitions."
