The package vulkan-memory-allocator is compatible with built-in CMake targets:

    find_package(vulkan-memory-allocator CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE vulkan-memory-allocator)

Including the header:
    #include "vk_mem_alloc.h"

Note that importing vulkan itself it not handled by this port. The header assumes that
    #include <vulkan/vulkan.h>
works.
