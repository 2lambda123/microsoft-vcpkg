The package libmpv provides CMake targets:

    find_package(libmpv REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE libmpv)


libmpv API provides general control over mpv playback. It does not give you
direct access to individual components of the player, only the whole thing.
It's somewhat equivalent to MPlayer's slave mode. You can send commands,
retrieve or set playback status or settings with properties, and receive
events.
The API can be used in two ways:
(1) Internally in mpv, to provide additional features to the command line
   player. Lua scripting uses this. (Currently there is no plugin API to
   get a client API handle in external user code. It has to be a fixed
   part of the player at compilation time.)
(2) Using mpv as a library with mpv_create(). This basically allows embedding
   mpv in other applications.
