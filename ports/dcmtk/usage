User Guide:
﻿
1. If you have not enabled the 'external-dict' feature in the 'vcpkg.json' file(default and recommended), 
you can skip the following content.
﻿
2. Otherwise, you need to perform the following steps:
 
2.1. Copy or Move the '${VCPKG-INSTALLED-DIR}/${VCPKG-TARGet-TRIPLET}/share/dcmtk-@VERSION@' directory to any place where you like.
		(e.g. 'usr/local/share/dcmdata' on Linux or 'C:/dcmdata' on Windows).
 
2.2. Set two environment variables, e.g.
 
	Windows:
		set DCMICONVPATH=C:/dcmdata
		set DCMDICTPATH=C:/dcmdata/dicom.dic;C:/dcmdata/private.dic
 
	Unix like:
		export DCMICONVPATH=usr/local/share/dcmdata
		export DCMDICTPATH=usr/local/share/dcmdata/dicom.dic:usr/local/share/dcmdata/private.dic
		
		
The DCMDICTPATH environment variable can even refer to several data dictionaries 
	separated by colons (":") on Unix systems, or semicolons (";") on Windows systems.
