DCMTK User Guide:
1、If the 'external-dict' feature is not enabled in the 'vcpkg.json' file in your project (which is the default and recommended setting), please skip the following contents.
2、Otherwise, follow these steps:
2.1、Copy or Move all the contents of the '@CURRENT_INSTALLED_DIR@/share/dcmtk-@VERSION@' directory to any desired location.
	(e.g., 'C:\dcmdata' on Windows or '/usr/local/share/dcmdata' on Unix-like systems).
2.2、Set two environment variables:
  For Windows:
	* set DCMICONVPATH=C:\dcmdata
	* set DCMDICTPATH=C:\dcmdata\dicom.dic;C:\dcmdata\private.dic
  For Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux or macOS):
	* export DCMICONVPATH=/usr/local/share/dcmdata
	* export DCMDICTPATH=/usr/local/share/dcmdata/dicom.dic:/usr/local/share/dcmdata/private.dic
Note: The `DCMDICTPATH` environment variable can refer to multiple data dictionaries, separated by colons (":") on Unix-like systems or semicolons (";") on Windows.
