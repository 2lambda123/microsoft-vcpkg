pulsar-client-cpp provides CMake targets:

  find_package(unofficial-pulsar CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE unofficial::pulsar::pulsar)

  # When VCPKG_LIBRARY_LINKAGE is static, both static and dynamic libraries will be generated
  # and the static library will be found. To link the dynamic library, set
  # PULSAR_FORCE_DYNAMIC_LIBRARY to ON.
