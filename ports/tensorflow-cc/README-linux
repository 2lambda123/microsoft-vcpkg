Warning: Static TensorFlow build contains several external dependencies that may cause linking conflicts
    (for example, one cannot use both openssl and TensorFlow in the same project, since TensorFlow contains boringssl).

Note: Beside TensorFlow itself, you'll need to also pass its dependencies to the linker:
    * libm
    * libdl
    * libpthread
for example, '-ltensorflow_cc -lm -ldl -lpthread'.

Note: There is no separate libtensorflow_framework.a as it got merged into libtensorflow_cc.a to avoid linking conflicts.

       For some TensorFlow features (e.g. OpRegistry), it might be necessary to convince the linker to include the whole library, i.e.,
       '-Wl,--whole-archive -ltensorflow_cc -Wl,--no-whole-archive -lstdc++ -lm -ldl -lpthread'
