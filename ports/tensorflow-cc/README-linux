Warning: Static TensorFlow build contains several external dependancies that may cause linking conflicts
         (e.g. you cannot use openssl in your projects as TensorFlow contains boringssl and so on).

Notes: Beside TensorFlow itself, you'll need to also pass its dependancies on the linker commandline, i.e.,
       '-ltensorflow_cc -lstdc++ -lm -ldl -lpthread'

       There is no separate libtensorflow_framework.a as it got merged into libtensorflow_cc.a to avoid linking conflicts.

       For some TensorFlow features (e.g. OpRegistry), it might be necessary to convince the linker to include the whole library, i.e.,
       '-Wl,--whole-archive -ltensorflow_cc -Wl,--no-whole-archive -lstdc++ -lm -ldl -lpthread'
