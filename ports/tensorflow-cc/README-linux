Note: Beside TensorFlow itself, you'll need to also pass its dependancies on the linker commandline, i.e.,
      '-ltensorflow_cc -ltensorflow_framework -lstdc++ -lm -ldl -lpthread'

      For the static port build libtensorflow_framework.a got merged into libtensorflow_cc.a to avoid linking conflicts,
      so you only need '-ltensorflow_cc'.

      For some TensorFlow features (e.g. OpRegistry), it might be necessary to convince the linker to include the whole library, i.e.,
      '-Wl,--whole-archive -ltensorflow_cc -Wl,--no-whole-archive -lstdc++ -lm -ldl -lpthread'
