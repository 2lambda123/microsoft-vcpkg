Warning: Static TensorFlow build contains several external dependancies that may cause linking conflicts
         (e.g. you cannot use openssl in your projects as TensorFlow contains boringssl and so on).

Note: For some TensorFlow features (e.g. OpRegistry), it might be necessary to convince the linker to include the whole library, i.e., link using options
      '/WHOLEARCHIVE:tensorflow_cc.lib /WHOLEARCHIVE:tensorflow_cc-part2.lib /WHOLEARCHIVE:tensorflow_cc-part3.lib ...'
