Warning: Static TensorFlow build contains several external dependancies that may cause linking conflicts
         (e.g. you cannot use openssl in your projects as TensorFlow contains boringssl and so on).

Notes: Beside TensorFlow itself, you'll need to also pass its dependancies on the linker commandline, i.e.,
       '-ltensorflow_cc -lstdc++ -framework CoreFoundation'

       There is no separate libtensorflow_framework.a as it got merged into libtensorflow_cc.a to avoid linking conflicts.

       For some TensorFlow features (e.g. OpRegistry), it might be necessary to convince the linker to include the whole library, i.e.,
       '-Wl,-force_load,path/to/libtensorflow_cc.a -lstdc++ -framework CoreFoundation -framework Security'
