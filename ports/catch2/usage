The package catch2 provides CMake targets:

    find_package(Catch2 CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(tests PRIVATE Catch2::Catch2)

    # Or to use the default Catch2 main function
    target_link_libraries(tests PRIVATE Catch2::Catch2WithMain)

If you are using catch2 and your tests no longer compile, you have 2 options.
1) Follow https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/migrate-v2-to-v3.md
2) Install catch2 with the feature 'v2'
