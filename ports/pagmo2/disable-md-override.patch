-# Explanation: on MSVC, when building static libraries, it is good practice to link
-# to the static runtime. CMake, however, is hard-coded to link to the dynamic runtime.
-# Hence we hackishly replace the /MD flag with /MT. This is the approach suggested
-# in the CMake FAQ:
-#
-# https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/FAQ#how-can-i-build-my-msvc-application-with-a-static-runtime
-#
-# Note that at one point CMake added the possiblity to set this as a target property,
-# so in the future we should definitely migrate to that approach:
